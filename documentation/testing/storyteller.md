<!--title:Using Storyteller against Jasper Systems-->

Jasper comes with a pre-built recipe for doing integration or acceptance testing with [Storyteller](http://storyteller.github.io) using
the *Jasper.TestSupport.Storyteller* extension library.

To get started with this package, create a new console application in your solution and add the `Jasper.TestSupport.Storyteller` Nuget dependency. Next,
in the `Program.Main()` method, use this code to connect your application to Storyteller:

<[sample:bootstrapping-storyteller-with-Jasper]>

In this case, `MyJasperAppRegistry` would be the name of whatever the `JasperRegistry` class is for your application.

If you want to hook into events during the Storyteller bootstrapping, teardown, or specification execution, you can subclass `JasperStorytellerHost<T>` like this:

<[sample:MyJasperStorytellerHarness]>

Then, your bootstrapping changes slightly to:

<[sample:running-MyJasperStorytellerHarness]>

## MessagingFixture

Jasper.Storyteller also comes with a `MessagingFixture` base class you can use to create Storyteller Fixtures that send messages to the running service bus with some facility to use
the built in <[linkto:testing/message_tracking]> to "know" when all the activity 
related to the message being sent has completed.

Here's a sample `MessagingFixture` from the sample project:

<[sample:TeamFixture]>

## Diagnostics

If there is any messages sent or received by the service bus feature during a Storyteller specification, there will be a custom results tab called "Messages" in the Storyteller
specification results that presents information about the message activity that will
look like this:

## External Nodes

<[warning]>
This isn't super duper mature yet. We had a similar feature in FubuMVC that we'd like to have back, so look for more here later.
<[/warning]>

It's not for the feint of heart, but it's also possible to write automated tests using Storyteller against additional
systems for true integration testing.

To bootstrap an additional Jasper application in the same Storyteller host, use the "external nodes" feature like this:

<[sample:adding-external-node]>

If you're using `MessagingFixture`, you'll have access to the external nodes as shown in this fixture:

<[sample:IncrementFixture]>
